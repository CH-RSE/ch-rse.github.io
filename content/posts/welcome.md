# Welcome

This is the first post of CH-RSE.
What is an RSE? Quoting [UK-RSE](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html):

> Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of the following questions, you are doing the work of a Research Software Engineer:
> 
> - Are you employed to develop software for research?
> - Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
> - Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
> - Are you the person who does computers in your research group?
> - Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
> - Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution through software?

Currently there is one official RSE group in Switzerland:

- [Research Software Engineering Community @ ETH Zurich](https://rse.ethz.ch/)

A second one is about to be started at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch)
