It was a pleasure having participated in the 1st onsite meeting of the ETHZ
RSE Community.
[A short wrapup of the event with photos](https://rse.ethz.ch/first_onsite_event.html).
On the 1st of February, around 60 participants met for talks and discussions
in Zurich.
For me the most interesting part was brainstorming the future of the RSE
movement in CH.
RSE.ethz will soon output a document outlining next steps.

## Lightning Talks

We had 8 lightning talks on very diverse subjects from different parts
of [ETHZ](https://ethz.ch) and [WSL](https://www.wsl.ch/en/).
Some were informative, some funny ("The smoke from this high-voltage
stress test is not an accident - though an accident looks the same"),
some very interesting.

## Invited Talk

Peter Schmidt, a trustee of the RSE Society UK, gave us an introduction
to the history of the RSE movement in the UK.
This was very interesting, considering that we're currently starting out
very young here in CH.
One of the next steps to define is whether we're already in the stage
of gathering the RSE movements in the different parts of CH under a
common umbrella.
As we're just starting out, it's not sure whether this is a good time to
do so, or whether we should wait a bit longer.

## Discussion

The discussion part was really good - we had 5 groups discussing the
short and long term goals, visibility of RSEs, and 
special interest and working groups.
Some points I'm really looking forward to:

- More knowledge and exchange meetings locally
- National RSE conference
- Mentorships between RSEs - [there is a UK program](https://society-rse.org/january-2024-newsletter/)
- Diversity programs
- Swiss RSE society

Stay tuned!
